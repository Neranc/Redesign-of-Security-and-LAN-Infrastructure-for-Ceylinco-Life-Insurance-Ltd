## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I led the **complete redesign of security and LAN infrastructure** for **Ceylinco Life Insurance Ltd**, one of Sri Lankaâ€™s largest insurance providers. The project focused on consolidating firewall policies, modernizing LAN architecture, and creating a **scalable, future-proof network** aligned with the companyâ€™s growth strategy.

## Business Challenges
- Legacy firewalls with inconsistent policies across branches.  
- Lack of application visibility and weak traffic control.  
- Limited segmentation between departments and systems.  
- Existing LAN infrastructure was outdated and not scalable.  

---

## Solution Implemented
The redesign introduced **next-generation firewalls and modern LAN architecture** with scalability and visibility at its core:  
- **Palo Alto NGFWs** for centralized security and policy enforcement.  
- **Advanced routing + VLAN segmentation** for traffic isolation.  
- **Application-aware traffic control** and deep packet inspection (DPI).  
- **Scalable design** to support business continuity and growth.

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Unified firewall policies**, reducing misconfigurations.  
- **Improved LAN performance** with VLAN-based segmentation.  
- **Application visibility** via app-ID and DPI features.  
- **Future-proof, scalable design** ready for expansion.  
- **Enhanced internal and external traffic inspection**.
